# NN-from-scratch
MNIST Digit Classification using a neural network I built from scratch using only numpy (NO ML libraries) with 2 layers.

In the code I have tried to comment the math and logic behind all my steps. Model training can take about 5-10 mins.
This finally achieves ~82% accuracy, examples of test cases are also shown with images.

Can be improved with more layers and more epochs possibly, but more layers will make the math complex without and automatic gradient calculator.
